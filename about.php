        <h2>About Megan</h2>
        <p>Megan grew up in Portland, Oregon. She moved to Yakima, Washington when she was 13 and spent the next 5 years there. In 2013 she moved back to Oregon to attend the Art Institute of Portland.
        <br>
            Megan has always been interested in art. As a teenager, she would spend hours at her local park drawing people, animals and trees. She chose to attend the Art Institute of Portland in order to purse her passion and get a degree in Fashion Design. While that didn't work out in the long run, Megan does plan to go back to school in the future and finish getting her degree.</p>
